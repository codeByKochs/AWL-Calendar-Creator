Trash Pick Up Schedule To Calendar Converter

This program imports  the trash pick up schedule from a local service provider (https://www.awl-neuss.de/nc/abfallkalender.html?streetSelector=POSTSTRA%C3%9FE&yearSelector=2020)
and converts it into a ics. file, which can be imported into a program like Mozilla Thunderbird.
